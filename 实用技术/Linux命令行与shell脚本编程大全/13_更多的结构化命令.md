# 13 更多的结构化命令

## 13.1 for命令

基本用法如下

```bash
for var in list; do
    commands
done
```

注意for遍历完之后，循环变量的值还剩下的shell脚本中还能访问

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# basic for command

for test in Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado; do
    echo "The next state is $test"
done

echo "The last state we visited was $test"
test=Connecticut
echo "Wait, now we're visiting $test"
```

输出

```bash
leo@ubuntu:~/sh_test$ ./test.sh
The next state is Alabama
The next state is Alaska
The next state is Arizona
The next state is Arkansas
The next state is California
The next state is Colorado
The last state we visited was Colorado
Wait, now we're visiting Connecticut
```
