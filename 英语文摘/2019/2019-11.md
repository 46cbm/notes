## Global Energy Transport Security

### Summary

- A series of attacks and detentions for oil cargo ships this year have made the Strait of Hormuz a geopolitical hotspot once again, harkening back 35 years to the so-called "tanker wars", part of the Iran-Iraq War.
- The Trump administration's April decision to re-impose sanctions against Iran's oil exports, coupled with the Iranian government's bellicose rhetorical response looms large as the reason for the recent flare-up in the Strait of Hormuz.
- The United States is expected to surpass Australia and Qatar to become the world's largest LNG(Liquified Natural Gas) exporter before 2025.
- LNG is volatile, and those tankers may be more vulnerable to attack than oil tankers.
