## Financial Services: Can The City Survive Brexit?

> from *The Economist*, Jun. 27, 2019

### Summary

A revival began in the 1960s when the offshore market for dollar leading boomed. Another lift came with the stockmarket deregulation of Big Bang in 1986 and again in 2000 when Lodon became a centre for trading the euro and emergin markets.

> The phrase `Big Bang`, used in reference to the sudden deregulation of financial markets, was coined to describe measures, including abolition of fixed commission charges and of the distinction between stockjobbers and stockbrokers on the London Stock Exchange and change from open-outcry to electronic, screen-based trading, effected by Margaret Thatcher in 1986.

London's success relies on stable politics and regulation, close ties to America and seamless ones to Europe. Brexit and Mr Corbyn threaten this formula in three ways.

## The Unique Culture Of Japanese Convenice Stores

### Summary

- A convenience store is not merely a place where customers come to buy practical necessities. It has to be somewhere they can enjoy and take pleasure in discovering things they like.
- In an attempt to appeal to locals, who often treat stores like a hub with multiple trips per week to pick up both food and household goods, new items are constantly introduced.
- But while you can find global favorites like ice cream, biscuits and chocolate bars, much of the convenience store food is often more in line with traditional Japanese flavours.
- Before the rise of the 1970's feminist movement in Japan, traditional family units meant more home-cooked meals. Now, with additional women entering the workforce, more people are opting for easy-to-eat options.
