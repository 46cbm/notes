## Why Economics Must Go Digital

### Summary

- Mainstream economics has largely failed to keep up with the rapid pace of digital transformation, and it is struggling to find practical ways to address the growing power of dominant tech companies. If economists want to remain relevant, they must rethink of their discipline's basic assumptions.
- Digital markets often become highly concentrated, with one dominant firm, because larger players enjoy significant returns to scale.
- Data generation plays a self-reinforing role: more data improves the service, which generates more data.

## Sweden: Europe's Historic, Current, And Future Innovation Hub

### Summary

- Over the last decade, Sweden has established itself as an innovation center, becoming well known across traditional tech circles as a hub of entrepreneurial activity.
- There are several objective reasons why Sweden fosters successful entrepreneurship: strong technical training in universities, school systems that encourage independent thinking and creativity, and substantial investments in infrastructure like super-fast broadband.
- In addition to those catalysts, we've noticed a unique set of circumstances in Sweden that affect the way Swedish entrepreneurs view the world and seize opportunities.
  - Social safety nets that exist in Sweden don't just benefit the poor, they also empower anyone who wants to take risks and build a business from the ground up.
  - Sweden is a small country with a population of only 10.2 million. Bacause the home market is not sizable, ambitious entrepreneurs who create companies in Sweden are forced to think globally from the onset.
  - Bacause of Sweden's small population, the country is often overlooked, and underserved, by large outside companies.
