## Why Economics Must Go Digital

### Summary

- Mainstream economics has largely failed to keep up with the rapid pace of digital transformation, and it is struggling to find practical ways to address the growing power of dominant tech companies. If economists want to remain relevant, they must rethink of their discipline's basic assumptions.
- Digital markets often become highly concentrated, with one dominant firm, because larger players enjoy significant returns to scale.
- Data generation plays a self-reinforing role: more data improves the service, which generates more data.
