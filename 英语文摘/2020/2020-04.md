## A United Ireland: Irish Unification Is Becoming Likelier

### Summary

- For most of the century since Ireland gained independence from Britain, control of the country has alternated between two parties. On February 8th that doupoly was smashed apart, when Sinn Fein got the largest share of first-preference votes in the republic's general election.
- The pressure for unification is about more than Brexit. Northen Ireland's census in 2021 is likely to confirm that Catholics outnumber Protestants for the first time.
